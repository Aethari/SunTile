# SunTile - A tilemap edtior for [Sun16](https://github.com/Aethari/Sun16)
SunTile is a tilemap editor designed for and with the in-development
[Sun16](https://github.com/Aethari/Sun16) game framework. It allows the
editing and creation of tilemaps with the .sdat (SunDATa) file format.  

See the Sun16 Project for more information.  

**This project is still under development. As it nears/reaches completion,
documentation will be created on how to use SunTile.**  
However, SunTile will be a pretty simple app, so don't expect much in the
way of the README (or the upcoming documentation).
